# AI-Ml-in-HeathCare
> Be **Aware** Be **Precautious** Be **Safe**

## Overview of the project
Enitre Projects is divided into three main parts :
* Admin Page for the laboratory Employees.
* DHC Page (Digital Health Card).
* Ayushman Bharat Web page.

## DHC Page
DHC - Digital Health Card is a unique health ID provided to every citizen to access halthcare services and their personal health records.This is linked with the adhar card, it is a Unique Identification numbers (UID).In this webpage 

## Ayushman Bharat Web page
Ayushman Bharat is a web page where each and every citizen can login with their DHC card and access their personal health records each and every time needed.It would be easier task than to carry health records each and everytime during the doctor appointment.The other use case is that they can book their appointment for the lab and also with the doctor and this web page helps in digitilizing the prescription by the doctor and also doctor can schedule next appointment id needed.

## Admin Page for the laboratory Employees.
This page is lab employees to update the records of the patients with their repective DHC Card number and their details.Here we us the AI for predecting the diseases and the AI prediction result will also be sent to the Ayushman Bharat Web Page and doctor can look into it and anaylse the result.NOTE:Now presently only covid detection is being implemented as a AI prediction but in the future more AI algorithims can be integrated.

## Overview of the Covid 19

COVID-19 is five times as lethal as the flu, causing considerable morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 pulmonary infection, like other pneumonias, causes inflammation and fluid in the lungs. COVID-19 appears on chest radiographs to be highly similar to other viral and bacterial pneumonias, making diagnosis difficult. Our Deeplearning models for detecting and localising COVID-19 might aid clinicians in making an accurate and timely diagnosis. As a result, patients may be able to receive the appropriate medication before the virus's most serious effects manifest.

## Installation of the Project procedure.
* HARDWARE: Basic Computer to work with deep learning models and GPU'S (optional but our code can also utilize GPU for faster training and testing).
* Python : Latest Current Stable version of python.
* Python packages are detailed separately in requirements.
* MySql 

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ 
```
